### ðŸ¤– About This Repository

This repository serves two main purposes:
1.  **A Showcase of My Work:** To demonstrate my proficiency in programming languages and my approach to solving complex problems.
2.  **A Personal Knowledge Base:** To act as a reference for myself to review past solutions and reinforce my understanding of key concepts.

### ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each problem is organized into its own folder, named after the problem title on LeetCode. Inside each folder, you will find:

* A source code file (e.g., `solution.py`, `solution.java`).
* A `README.md` file containing the original problem description, constraints, and examples.

This structure makes it easy to navigate and find specific solutions.

###  Disclaimer

Please note that the solutions in this repository reflect my approach at the time of solving. While they are all "Accepted" by the LeetCode judge, they may not always represent the most optimal solution. I am always learning and refining my methods.
